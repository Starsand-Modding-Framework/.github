# 🧩 Starsand Mod Framework (SMF)

**The unofficial community modding ecosystem for _Starsand Island_**  
Built with ❤️ by players – for creativity, fun and long-term game support.

## 🌟 What is SMF?

SMF (Starsand Mod Framework) is a planned open-source modding framework for the upcoming game **Starsand Island**, inspired by tools like **Fabric** and **Forge** from Minecraft.

We aim to make modding:

- ✅ Safe – no core modification required
- ✅ Flexible – powerful APIs and modular structure
- ✅ Open – community driven and fully transparent
- ✅ Fun – for creating creative extensions

---

## 🛠️ What's planned?

- `mod.yml` standard with dependencies and mod types (`mod`, `library`)
- Dynamic event system for hooks
- Interfaces like `IPlayer`, `IInventory`, `IGameWorld` for safe mod access
- `StarUI` – optional UI toolkit for mod menus & overlays
- Optional mod portal & mod review team for security

---

## 💬 Community-Focus

We believe that modding can **bring life and depth to a game**, and we want to give players the tools to create. All of this is made with:

- 🔓 Open Source principles
- 🔄 Full transparency with the developers (if allowed)
- 💖 Respect for the game and its integrity
